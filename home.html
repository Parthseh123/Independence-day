      </div>
      <div class="abpara2">
        <p>Independence Day, in India, national holiday celebrated annually on August 15.
          Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the establishment of a free and
          independent Indian nation. It also marks the anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent
          into two countries, India and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14‚Äì15, 1947.
          (In Pakistan, Independence Day is celebrated on August 14.)
          British rule in India began in 1757 when, following the British victory at the Battle of
          Plassey, the English East India Company began exercising control over the country.
          The East India Company ruled India for 100 years, until it was replaced by direct
          British rule (often referred to as the British raj) in the wake of the Indian Mutiny in
          1857‚Äì58. The Indian independence movement began during World War I and was led by Mohandas
          K. Gandhi, who advocated for a peaceful and nonviolent end to British rule.</p>

        <p>
          India, the largest democratic nation in the world got independence from foreign rule in 1947
          . It was a momentous year in the history of India when it gained freedom from the British rule
          that lasted for about 100 years. In 1857, the powers of British East India Company was transferred
          to the British Crown but the Company which was started as early as in 1600 to build colonisation
          and trade which gradually imposed its rule in many parts of the country, both economically and
          politically. Prior to that many parts of India were under the control of the Portuguese, French
          and the Dutch. As the Indian subcontinent had no political unity or unifying force since
          ancient times, many have come and controlled parts of the country. Prominent and long lasting
          among them were the Mughals, who ruled most parts of the present country from the 16th century
          through 18th century.</p>
